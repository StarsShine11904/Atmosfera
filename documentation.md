# Atmosfera Resource Pack Documentation

To get an idea of how to build Atmosfera Resource Packs, it's easiest to look at the included "dungeons" resource pack.  
It can be found under [this link](src/main/resources/resourcepacks/dungeons), or by opening the mod jar with any zip program and navigating into the `resourcepacks` directory.

Atmosfera Resource Packs are laid out like this:

```
assets/
  <namespace>/
    sounds.json
    sounds/
      ambient/
        definitions/
      music/
        definitions/
    lang/
      en_us.json
pack.mcmeta
pack.png
```

## sounds.json (Vanilla)

To be able to use sounds and music, they first have to be registered using the vanilla `sounds.json`. Here's a quick example:

```
{
  "dungeons_wind": {
    "sounds": [
      "atmosfera:ambient/wind/wind_rumble_loop_1_1",
      "atmosfera:ambient/wind/wind_rumble_loop_1_2"
    ],
    "subtitle": "subtitle.atmosfera.dungeons_wind"
  },
  "dungeons_swamp_soggy_cave": {
    "sounds": [
      "atmosfera:music/swamp/swamp_soggier_cave_ost"
    ]
  }
}
```

This means `dungeons_wind` is an ambient sound that plays one of  
`assets/atmosfera/sounds/ambient/wind/wind_rumble_loop_1_1.ogg`
`assets/atmosfera/sounds/ambient/wind/wind_rumble_loop_1_2.ogg`  
and uses a subtitle with translation key `subtitle.atmosfera.dungeons_wind` (defined in `en_us.json` or any other language code).  
Similarly `dungeons_swamp_soggy_cave` is music that plays  `assets/atmosfera/sounds/music/swamp/swamp_soggier_cave_ost.ogg`

For more details about `sounds.json`, see the [Minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sounds.json).

## Sound Definitions

`sounds/ambient/definitions` and `sounds/music/definitions` are the meat of Atmosfera Resource Packs.  
Each json file inside these directories defines either an ambient sound or a music track that plays under certain environmental conditions.  
Here's an example of what that might look like:

```
{
  "sound": "atmosfera:dungeons_wind",
  "default_volume": 100,
  "default_subtitle": true,
  "shape": "sphere",
  "size": "small",
  "modifiers": [
    {
      "type": "percent_block",
      "blocks": [
        "minecraft:air"
      ],
      "range": [
        0.6,
        0.7
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "sky_visibility",
      "min": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```
This reads roughly as "the `atmosfera:dungeons_wind` sound can play when 50% of a small sphere around the player is in skylight and at least 60% of it is air, maxing the volume when it reaches 70%."

`"sound"` is the sound to be played, defined in `sounds.json`.

`"default_volume"` and `"default_subtitle"` (both optional) define the default Atmosfera config values for the volume (in %) and whether the subtitles are enabled.  

`"shape"` and `"size"` define the environment, aka the space around the player where the input data is being pulled from.  
`"shape"` allows: `"sphere"` (all around the player), `"upper_hemisphere"` (top half of the sphere), `"lower_hemisphere"` (bottom half of the sphere).  
`"size"` allows: `"large"` (radius 16), `"medium"` (radius 8), `"small"` (radius 4).

`"modifiers"` define the environmental conditions under which the sound should play.  
(See next section.)

The name of a definition file doesn't really matter as long as it's unique. It is good practice to use the same name as the sound it plays, e.g. the example above should be called `dungeons_wind.json`.

### Modifiers (aka Conditions)

Modifiers look for example like this:
```
{
  "type": "sky_visibility",
  "min": 0.5
}
```
This reads as "at least 50% of blocks in the environment are in skylight".

Modifiers have a `"type"` and may accept different parameters.

Think of modifiers as functions, taking a certain input and outputting a number - usually between 0 and 1.  
When there are multiple modifiers, their outputs are multiplied.  
This final output is then used as a volume for ambient sounds (but not for music).  
If the final output is close to 0, the sound will not play.  
Since multiplying by 0 gives 0, modifiers are basically chained like a logical "and"; The sound will only play if all modifiers output non-0 values.

The different types of modifiers are:

#### Boolean Conditions

Parameters:

- `"value"`: boolean (optional)  
  `"value": false` will invert the condition.

Types:

- `"is_daytime"`  
  Outputs 1 if it is day, else 0.

- `"is_rainy"`  
  Outputs 1 if it rains, else 0.

- `"is_stormy"`  
  Outputs 1 if it storms, else 0.

<details><summary>Examples</summary>

```
{
  "type": "is_rainy"
}
```
"Play only when it rains."

```
{
  "type": "is_daytime",
  "value": false
}
```
"Play only at night."
</details>

#### Bounded Conditions

Parameters:

- `"min"`: number (optional)  
  When the input is smaller than `"min"` return 0, else return the input.  

- `"max"`: number (optional)  
  When the input is larger than `"max"` return 0, else return the input.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

```
          / <- max
         /
        /
min -> /

0 ______   ____
       |   |
     min   max
```
(Graph if both are used, which they rarely are.)

Since `"min"` and `"max"` return the input as-is if in bounds, this will effectively also limit the output (volume). This does not apply to music, since music ignores volume.
</details>

- `"range": [lower, upper]"`: numbers (optional)  
  Output linearly grows from 0 to 1 on the interval from `[lower, upper]`.  
  Applies after `"min"` and `"max"`.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

```
          ____ 1
         /|
        / |
       /  |
      /   |
0 ___/    |
     |    |
 lower    upper
```

When the input is smaller than `lower` return 0.  
When the input is larger than `upper` return 1.  
Else output `(input - lower) / (upper - lower)`.  
 
Works similar to `"min"`, except it gives control over the output (volume). It is useful for rare events which would otherwise have a low volume, e.g. `"range": [0.1, 0.3]"` would max the volume when the input reaches 0.3.
