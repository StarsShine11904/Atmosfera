## 2.5.2

You know what? We didn't have any fixes for fundamentally broken features this year yet, so here you go!

- fix `is_daytime` modifier believing it is always day (you can hear owls and crickets now!)
- fix sounds never replaying after they get muted once
- (re)loading Atmospheric Resource Packs does not require reloading the world anymore

## 2.5.1

- add Traditional Chinese (zh_tw) translation, thanks to StarsShine11904!

## 2.5.0

- port to 1.21.11
- Atmospheric Resource Packs: replace `"dimension_effects"` modifier with `"dimension"`, which does exactly what you expect  
  (for backwards compatibility, `"dimension_effects"` is an alias to `"dimension"`, even if they're not exactly the same)

## 2.4.0

This update addresses many issues with Atmospheric Resource Packs:

- added [documentation](https://github.com/Haven-King/Atmosfera/blob/main/documentation.md) for how to create your own Atmospheric Resource Packs!
- fix `"min"` and `"max"` not doing anything for many modifiers like `"percent_biome"` and bounded modifiers (the irony...)
- add `"range"` to all bounded modifiers
- fix `"default_volume"` and `"default_subtitle"` not being read or used
- some modifiers had alternative type names which have now been removed
- the internal "Dungeons" Atmospheric Resource Packs has been updated to use newer blocks, biomes and tags, including common "c" tags, which should improve modded biome detection
- config logic has partially been rewritten

## 2.3.1

- adjust thread pool for environment context update

the pool works like it did before 2.1.0 except it only uses 2 threads
this also fixes an issue where small and medium sphere update tasks would run less often than intended

- run environment context update at most every second

saves some wattage, probably has little to no effect on FPS/TPS

## 2.3.0

- port to 1.21.9
- fix another 2 bugs in how music was chosen - these should be the last!

the bugs resulted in custom music being less likely to play than intended and some custom tracks being skipped

- add a "Custom Music Weight Scale" option, to tune the likelihood of playing custom music

this is by default set to 250% as custom music was very rare to play, since there's so little of it
